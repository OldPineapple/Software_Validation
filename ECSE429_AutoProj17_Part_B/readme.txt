The programming language we used to implement step definitions is python.

The story test automation tool we used is "behave".

In order to use "behave", make sure it is installed. You can find how to install it on this webpage: https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

After "behave" is installed, to test our story test, make sure you are in the directory where .feature or .py files locate in command-line interfaces like terminal.

Simply type behave and press enter to run all story tests.

You do not need to tell behave which ones of .py files to use - it will use all of them.
For full details of behave, you can refer to https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html.
