This folder contains the test script of the unit test and the recording video that demontrate the test.
Before run the test script make sure you install python3 and install third-party library requests by command pip install requests.
And make sure you are in the right root where 'runTodoManagerRestAPI-1.5.5.jar' locates, thank you.
