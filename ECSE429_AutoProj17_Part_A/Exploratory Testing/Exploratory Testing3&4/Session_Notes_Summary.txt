Summary of session findings:
• We learnt that for /:id commands, we did not need to include ':' sign in the command.
• We learnt that /todos/:id was a more specific version of /todos.
• We learnt that todos had relation with taskof.
• We learnt that todos had relation with categories.
• We learnt that projects had relation with categories.
• We learnt that projects had relation with tasks.
• We learnt that when we called /shutdown, the server was shutdown so we would get error when we use GET. 
• We learnt that some functions were not behave as documented, but they might be other unducumented capabilities.
• We learnt that not all the errors found were actual bugs, they needed further detailed tests to check again.

List of concerns identified in session:
• Several errors were met during the session, were those errors related?
• Was any error the reason why other errors occured?
• Would any error cause a great effect to the system?

List of new testing ideas identified in session:
• Since we just followed the sequence to test capabilities, what if we do the test in a random order?
• Since we just used valid parameters as inputs to test capabilities, what if we use invalid inputs?
• If we change a passed test to incorrect, will it affect other passed tests?
• Although functions are documented, do they always perform like documented or just a coincidence?
