The programming language we used to implement performance testing is python.

The operating system tool we used to do dynamic analysis is Windows perfmon.

The static analysis tool we used is Sonar Cube.

Place a runTodoManagerRestAPI-1.5.5.jar file in the HOME directory on your laptop.

Before run the test script make sure you install python3 and install third-party library requests using command pip install requests.

All performance tests are in folder Performance Testing, to run the test, you can open each file with Visual Studio Code, right click on it and select Run Python File in Terminal. Or directly click the triangle button on the top right corner, which is also run python file in terminal.

Each program will run 5 numbers, which are 10, 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, you can revise them in "num" variable in each function.

When the number of to-dos, projects, contexts is small, the program is stable. However, when the number is quite large (still smaller than 10000), the program becomes a bit unstable. If errors occur, kill terminal and run several more times or change num to smaller number, it will run successfully at last.

Windows Perfmon folder includes the file generated by perfmon and their excel version. Graphs are also shown in each excel file.
